### ***Eligibility***

>(a) a family member;

>(b) a friend; or

>(c) any other volunteer from:

>>(i) the Community Justice Centre; or

>>(ii) any other pro bono agency or entity as recognised by the Court.

>(b) has a direct or indirect interest in the outcome of a claim in the dispute;

>(c) is an advocate or solicitor or a legally qualified person from any jurisdiction; or

>(d) is a housing agent of the LIP and the dispute involves a tenancy or any other housing matter in which the housing agent is acting for the LIP.

### ***Scope of assistance by CCT Friend***

(4) Subject to paragraph (5), a CCT Friend may provide administrative and emotional support to the LIP in the conduct of his case in proceedings before the Court or Registrar, such as —

>(a) assisting the LIP to prepare and file documents relevant to the proceedings;

>(b) providing emotional and moral support; 

>(c) offering practical guidance to the LIP on non-legal issues in the course of the proceedings;

>(d) assisting the LIP in the proceedings, such as:

### ***Procedure***

(6) An LIP may submit a request for the appointment of a CCT Friend using the relevant Form in the Community Justice and Tribunals System, with the accompanying undertaking and declaration duly signed.

(7) Any request submitted under paragraph (6) shall be considered and decided upon by the Court at the pre-trial conference or case management conference fixed after the request is submitted, or on the hearing day scheduled for the LIP’s matter.  

(8) If another party objects to the presence of or assistance to be given by a CCT Friend to the LIP, he must provide reasons at the start of the pre-trial conference, case management conference or hearing (as the case may be) for the Court to consider.

(9) A Court may reject any request for the appointment of a CCT Friend if it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice and fairness for the LIP to receive assistance from a CCT Friend. 

(10) If the request is rejected by a registrar, the LIP must carry on his own case without the assistance of a CCT Friend at the hearing before the registrar. However, he may make a fresh request before the Court on the first day of hearing of his matter. 

(11) If the request is rejected by the Court (other than a Registrar), the LIP must carry on his own case without the assistance of a CCT Friend at the hearing before the Court. A decision by a Court to approve or reject the request shall be final.   

(12) An LIP may have only one CCT Friend providing assistance and support at any one time during the proceedings. An LIP who wishes to change his CCT friend at any stage of the proceedings must file a fresh request to the Court, as the case may be.  

(13) At any time during the proceedings, a Court may regulate the manner in which assistance is provided to the LIP, by: 

>(a) cautioning the CCT Friend to cease any offending behaviour;

>(b) restricting or stopping the CCT Friend from assisting the LIP;

>(c) directing the CCT Friend to leave the hearing room or chamber; or

>(d) revoking any permission given to the party for the CCT Friend to assist him,

>if it is of the opinion that the administration of justice is being impeded by the CCT Friend such as (but not limited to) where — 

>>(i) the assistance provided by the CCT Friend is improper; 

>>(ii) the assistance provided by the CCT Friend is unreasonable in nature or degree;  

>>(iii) it is apparent to the Court or the opposing party that the CCT friend is not competent enough to interpret spoken communications or the relevant part(s) of the document(s) referred to in the proceedings;

>>(iv) the CCT Friend becomes disruptive through his words or behaviour;

>>(v) the CCT Friend distracts the LIP or takes over the proceedings on behalf of the LIP, or seeks or attempts to act as a lawyer for the LIP such as by speaking directly to the opposing party;

>>(vi) allowing the CCT Friend to remain would not be in the interests of justice and fairness or where it would obstruct the efficient administration of justice;  

>>(vii) the CCT Friend is disqualified from being as such under paragraph (3); or

>>(viii) the CCT Friend breaches any prohibition in paragraph (5).
