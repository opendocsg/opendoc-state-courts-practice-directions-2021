# PART XIV: BILLS OF COSTS FOR ASSESSMENT

## 102. Basis of assessment

Every bill of costs to be assessed pursuant to a judgment or order of Court must be filed together with a copy of the judgment or order of Court. Where an order for assessment is not required under the Rules of Court 2021, the bill of costs shall describe succinctly in its heading the basis of assessment. A bill of costs for assessment between a solicitor and his client pursuant to section 120(3) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) must be filed together with a copy of the document signifying the consent of the parties to assessment.


## 103. Form of bills of costs

The attention of solicitors is drawn to Rules 2, 10 and 20 and Appendix 1 of Order 21 of the Rules of Court 2021. In addition, solicitors are to abide by the following requirements in relation to the form of bills of costs.

(1) Margins

>A blank margin of not less than 10mm wide must be provided on all four sides for each page of the bill of costs.

(2) Pagination

>Every page of a bill of costs must be paginated consecutively at the centre of the top of the page. The attention of solicitors is drawn to Practice Direction 88 regarding pagination of documents filed using the Electronic Filing Service.

(3) Format

>(a) Party-and-party bills:

>>(i) A bill of costs drawn up for assessment between one party to proceedings and another should be divided into three separate sections as required by Order 21, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court 2021.

>>(ii) Form 25 in Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions should be used for contentious business in respect of work done for a trial or in contemplation of a trial.

>>(iii) Form 26 in Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions should be used for contentious business in respect of, or in contemplation of, work done other than for a trial (such as work done for an appeal or for a specific interlocutory application).

>(b) Solicitor-and-own-client bills:

>>(i) A bill of costs drawn up for assessment (pursuant to any written law) between a solicitor and his own client should be drawn up in the same manner described in sub-paragraph (a) above save as follows:

>>>(A) A solicitor will be deemed to have indicated that all items included in the bill are in relation to work done or disbursements incurred with the approval of the client.

>>>(B) Any agreement, whether oral or in writing, between the solicitor and his own client relating to the amount of costs payable either as a global sum or in respect of particular items included in the bill should be indicated on the bill.

>>>(C) Any agreement between the solicitor and his own client as to the rate to be used to compute the solicitor’s costs should also be indicated in the bill.

>>(ii) Form 27 in Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions should be used for non-contentious business.

A waiver of the filing fees for the solicitor-and-own-client bill may be requested for when this bill is filed.

>>(ii) The party-and-party bill should be filed first and the solicitor-and-own-client should reference the first bill.

>>(iii) The party-and-party bill and the solicitor-and-own-client bill can be drawn up as described in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above with the modification set out in sub-paragraph (iv) below.

>>(iv) It is not necessary to repeat serially in the solicitor-and-own-client bill the items which have been serially set out in the party-and-party bill. It is sufficient, ordinarily, to incorporate all such items by reference and proceed to set out in detail any additional items, ie, items not already set out in the party-and-party bill. However, if a sum claimed for an item of disbursement in the solicitor-and-own-client bill is different from the corresponding sum claimed in the party-and-party bill, it will be necessary to set out serially again in the solicitor-and-own-client bill all the items of disbursement already set out in the party-and-party bill (including, where appropriate, the different sum or sums claimed) as well as additional items of disbursement not so set out. In addition, the global sums claimed for sections 1 and 2 of the solicitor-and-own-client bill should be indicated at the end of the respective sections whether or not they are the same sums as those claimed for sections 1 and 2 of 
the party-and-party bill.

(4) Particulars

>(a) Sufficient particulars must be included in the bill of costs so as to enable the Registrar to exercise his discretion under Order 21, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court 2021.

>(b) Without prejudice to paragraph (3) above, the Registrar may, at the assessment hearing, order the claiming or receiving party to furnish full details in support of the sums claimed under the bill.

>>(iii) be accompanied by a bill of costs summary composed online through the Electronic Filing Service. 

>(d) The information required by the Electronic Filing Service to compose the bill of costs summary includes the costs claimed under Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the bill of costs.

(5) Goods and Services Tax

>A party claiming goods and services tax ( “**GST**”) in a bill of costs must comply with the directions set out in this paragraph. A party who fails to comply with the directions set out in this paragraph will be presumed not to be claiming GST in the bill concerned.

>>(i) The first and second sections of the bill of costs, which set out the work done in the cause or matter except for assessment of costs and the work done for and in the assessment of costs, should each be divided into such number of parts as will enable the bill to reflect the different rates of GST applicable during the relevant period of time.

>>(ii) The third section, which sets out the disbursements made in the cause or matter, should similarly be divided, with the first part setting out the disbursements on which no GST is chargeable by the solicitors for the receiving party or the receiving party, as the case may be.
