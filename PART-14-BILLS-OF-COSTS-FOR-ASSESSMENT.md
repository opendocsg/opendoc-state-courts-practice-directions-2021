# PART XIV: BILLS OF COSTS FOR ASSESSMENT

## 102. Basis of assessment

Every bill of costs to be assessed pursuant to a judgment or order of Court must be filed together with a copy of the judgment or order of Court. Where an order for assessment is not required under the Rules of Court 2021, the bill of costs shall describe succinctly in its heading the basis of assessment. A bill of costs for assessment between a solicitor and his client pursuant to section 120(3) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 must be filed together with a copy of the document signifying the consent of the parties to assessment.


## 103. Form of bills of costs

>A blank margin of not less than 10mm wide must be provided on all four sides for each page of the bill of costs.

>>(i) A bill of costs drawn up for assessment between one party to proceedings and another should be divided into three separate sections as required by Order 21, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court 2021.

>>(ii) [Form 25](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2025.pdf) in Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions should be used for contentious business in respect of work done for a trial or in contemplation of a trial.

>>(iii) [Form 26](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2026.pdf) in Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions should be used for contentious business in respect of, or in contemplation of, work done other than for a trial (such as work done for an appeal or for a specific interlocutory application).

>(b) Solicitor-and-own-client bills:

>>(i) A bill of costs drawn up for assessment (pursuant to any written law) between a solicitor and his own client should be drawn up in the same manner described in sub-paragraph (a) above save as follows:

>>(i) Whenever a solicitor-and-own-client bill is required to be assessed by virtue of the above-captioned Act, a bill should be drawn up for assessment between the solicitor and his own client *and* another bill drawn up for assessment between the client and the other party to the proceedings in which the solicitor acted for the client. A waiver of the filing fees for the solicitor-and-own-client bill may be requested for when this bill is filed.

>>(ii) The party-and-party bill should be filed first and the solicitor-and-own-client bill should reference the first bill.

It is sufficient, ordinarily, to incorporate all such items by reference and proceed to set out in detail any additional items, *ie*, items not already set out in the party-and-party bill. However, if a sum claimed for an item of disbursement in the solicitor-and-own-client bill is different from the corresponding sum claimed in the party-and-party bill, it will be necessary to set out serially again in the solicitor-and-own-client bill all the items of disbursement already set out in the party-and-party bill (including, where appropriate, the different sum or sums claimed) as well as additional items of disbursement not so set out. In addition, the global sums claimed for sections 1 and 2 of the solicitor-and-own-client bill should be indicated at the end of the respective sections whether or not they are the same sums as those claimed for sections 1 and 2 of 
the party-and-party bill.

>>(ii) The third section, which sets out the disbursements made in the cause or matter, should similarly be divided, with the first part setting out the disbursements on which no GST is chargeable by the solicitors for the receiving party or the receiving party, as the case may be.
