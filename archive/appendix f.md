### 1. **APPLICATION**

1.1. This Protocol applies to all defamation (including libel and slander) actions. 

1.2. Parties are expected to comply with the framework prescribed in this Protocol before commencing proceedings in the State Courts. 

>(a) Notwithstanding this, parties may adapt the forms where necessary to suit the facts of their case.

>(b) This Protocol is in addition to any negotiations that parties may be conducting privately or on a "without prejudice" basis.

1.3. In following this Protocol, the parties should act reasonably to keep costs proportionate to the nature and gravity of the case and the stage that the complaint has reached. 

### 2. **OBJECTIVES**

2.1. This Protocol aims to:

>(a) improve pre-action communication between parties by establishing a timetable for the exchange of information and documents;

>(b) encourage constructive negotiations in order to improve the chances of a pre-action settlement; and

>(c) set standards for the content of pre-action correspondence between parties which will in turn lead to clear pleadings and streamlined issues if proceedings are commenced.

### 3. **LETTER OF CLAIM**
 
3.1. Before commencing proceedings, the claimant must send a letter of claim to the potential defendant. The letter of claim must be prepared in accordance with [Form 34](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2034.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions. 

3.2. The letter of claim should be marked “Private and Confidential. To be opened by addressee only” and it should not be marked “without prejudice”. It must include the following information:

>(a) the name of the claimant;

>(b) sufficient details to identify the publication or broadcast which contained the words complained of;

>(c) the person(s) to whom the words complained of were published, broadcasted or spoken;

>(d) the exact words complained of and the date of publication or broadcast (if known), and where possible, a copy, screenshot or transcript of the words complained of should be enclosed;

>(e) if the words complained of are not in the English language, a translation of the words in the English language;  

>(f) sufficient details of the factual inaccuracies or unsupportable comments within the words complained of to enable the potential defendant to appreciate why the words are inaccurate or unsupportable;

>(g) where relevant, any fact and matter which makes the claimant identifiable from the words complained of;

>(h) where relevant, details of any special fact relevant to the interpretation of the words complained of and the meanings which the claimant attributes to the words complained of;

>(i) where relevant, any particular damage caused by the words complained of; 

>(j) the nature of the remedies sought by the claimant, for which purpose —

>>(i) if the claimant is seeking monetary damages, he should indicate the quantum sought and as far as possible, refer to relevant case precedents and/or other authorities; and

>>(ii) if the claimant is seeking a retraction, clarification, apology and/or undertaking, he should enclose a draft for the potential defendant’s execution (a sample can be found at [Form 35](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2035.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions);

>(k) the timeframe given for the potential defendant to respond. Save in cases where there is exceptional urgency, the potential defendant should be given at least 14 days to respond. If a shorter timeframe is imposed, the claimant should explain the reasons for the urgency; and

>(l) a statement by the claimant as to which of the alternative dispute resolution ("**ADR**") options set out at paragraph 6 of this Protocol he proposes to use for the resolution of the dispute for the potential defendant to consider.

3.3. The letter of claim must be sent to the potential defendant by way of certificate of posting, registered post or any other mode which provides the claimant with a written acknowledgement of posting / delivery.

3.4. Nothing in this Protocol should be construed to operate as a stay of the time limited for the doing of any act as prescribed by the Limitation Act (Cap 163). If, by reason of complying with any part of this Protocol, a claim may be time-barred under any provision of the Limitation Act, the claimant may commence proceedings without complying with this Protocol, or so much of this Protocol that he is unable to comply with by reason of the impending operation of an applicable limitation period. 

### 4. **RESPONSE TO LETTER OF CLAIM**

4.1. The potential defendant must provide a response to the claimant within 14 days of the receipt of the letter of claim (or such other time limit as specified in the letter of claim). The response must be in accordance with [Form 36](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2036.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions. 

4.2. If the potential defendant is unable to respond substantively within 14 days (or such other time limit as specified), he must acknowledge receipt within the said 14 days (or any shorter time limit specified) and inform the claimant of the length of time required to respond substantively to the claim. A sample acknowledgement can be found at [Form 37](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2037.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions.

>(b) if the claim is accepted in whole or in part, which remedies the potential defendant is willing to offer (if the potential defendant is willing to offer monetary payment, he should specify the quantum and as far as possible; relevant case precedents and/or other authorities should also be referred to);

>(c) if more information is required, precisely what information is needed in order to enable the claim to be dealt with and why;

>(e) where relevant, the meanings which the potential defendant attributes to the words complained of; 

>(f) whether the potential defendant agrees to any of the ADR options proposed by the claimant, and if not, which of the ADR options set out at paragraph 6 of this Protocol he wishes to propose for the resolution of the dispute; and

>(g) whether the potential defendant intends to make a counterclaim for defamation, and if so, the information at paragraph 3.2.

4.4 The acknowledgement of receipt or response must be sent by way of certificate of posting, registered post or any other mode which provides the potential defendant with a written acknowledgement of posting / delivery.

4.5 If no response is received by the claimant within the timeframe set out in the letter of claim, the claimant is entitled to commence proceedings without further compliance with this Protocol. 

### 5. **COUNTERCLAIM**

5.1. If the potential defendant intends to make a counterclaim for defamation and states so in his response, the claimant should provide a response to any such counterclaim within the equivalent period allowed to the potential defendant to respond to the letter of claim. The claimant's response to the potential defendant's counterclaim for defamation shall contain the information at sub-paragraphs 4.3(a) to 4.3(f). 

### 6. **ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ("ADR") OPTIONS**

>(a) mediation at the Singapore Mediation Centre;

>(b) mediation at the Singapore International Mediation Centre; and 

>(c) mediation under the Law Society Mediation Scheme.

6.2. The above list is non-exhaustive and parties are free to consider and propose other ADR mechanisms to resolve the dispute. 

6.3. If the claimant and the potential defendant are able to agree on a mode of ADR, the claimant should submit the relevant request for ADR (depending on chosen mode of ADR) within 14 days of the parties' agreement to initiate the ADR process. 

6.4. No party can be compelled to enter into any form of ADR.
