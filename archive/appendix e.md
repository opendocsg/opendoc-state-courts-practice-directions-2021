## APPENDIX E: Protocol for Medical Negligence Claims

### **PART ONE: PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS BEFORE ACTION**

### 1. **Aim of protocol on production of documents before action**

1.1. In order for a claimant to consider whether he or she has a viable claim or cause of action against his or her doctor and/or hospital ("**health care providers**") for medical negligence, a medical report and medical records of the patient from the health care providers are often essential. 

1.2. The aim of Part One of the Protocol for Medical Negligence Claims ("**the Protocol**") is to establish a protocol on production of documents before action. It is to prescribe a framework for exchange of information prior to the filing of an Originating Claim with a view to resolving medical negligence disputes arising out of an alleged negligent act or omission in connection with medical or dental diagnosis or treatment without protracted litigation. It is hoped that this will help to standardise and streamline the production of medical records to a claimant who is considering pursuing a medical negligence claim. It aims to facilitate the exchange of relevant information and medical records so as to increase the prospect that medical negligence disputes can be resolved quickly.

1.3. Part One of the Protocol will apply from the time a claimant contemplates commencing a medical negligence suit in Court against his or her health care providers. 

1.4. The Protocol does not affect any privilege that may apply to communication between parties undertaken in compliance with it (including medical reports and medical records furnished to the claimant's solicitor by the health care providers pursuant to the Protocol).

### 2. **Letter of request for medical report and other related medical records**

2.1. The application for the medical report and medical records that may be necessary for the claimant and/or his or her solicitors to ascertain if he or she has a viable cause of action should be made by way of a letter in [Form 32](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2032.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions setting out briefly the basis of the claim and the nature of the information sought in the medical report, including:

>(a)	symptoms presented by the claimant or the deceased (in the case where the patient has passed away and the claim is pursued by his or her next-of-kin or executor or administrator of his or her estate) prior to treatment;

>(b)	clinical findings;

>(c)	diagnosis;

>(d)	treatment prescribed, risks in such treatment (if any) and when and how these risks were communicated to the claimant or the deceased and/or his or her next-of-kin;

>(e)	whether alternatives to the prescribed treatment were discussed and disclosed to the claimant or the deceased and/or his or her next-of-kin and if so, why the prescribed treatment was preferred over these alternatives;

>(f)	assessment of the claimant's or the deceased's condition at the last consultation and the cause of such condition or the cause of the deceased's death (if applicable); and

>(g)	prognosis and recommended future treatment, if available.

2.2. The above guidelines on the contents of the medical report are meant to ensure that the report is as comprehensive as possible. Depending on the facts and nature of the medical management in each case, the contents of the medical report may be suitably modified. The application for the medical report may be dispensed with where the harm caused to the patient is *res ipsa loquitur*.

2.3. If the claimant and/or his or her solicitor wish to obtain copies of medical records from the health care provider, this should also be made clear in the letter of request. The various types of medical records that the claimant and/or his or her solicitor may seek from the health care provider are set out in [Form 32](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2032.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions. However, as the medical records to be sought from the health care provider would depend on the nature and focus of the complaint, the type of medical treatment rendered and advice sought as well as whether the health care provider is a medical doctor and/or hospital, the medical records listed in [Form 32](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2032.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions are not exhaustive, but act as a guide. The claimant and/or his or her solicitor can request any other medical records that are relevant and necessary for the claim.

2.4. As the above and the sample letter of request are guides only, the contents of the actual letter of request and medical report can be suitably modified depending on the facts and nature of medical management of each case.

2.5. The application for the medical report/medical records should be accompanied by a Consent Form set out in [Form 33](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2033.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions signed by the claimant authorising the health care provider to release the medical report/medical records to the claimant's solicitor.

2.6. Within 7 days of receipt of the application, the health care provider is to inform the claimant what the requisite charges are for the medical report and medical records.

2.7. The medical report and medical records should be provided to the claimant within 6 weeks upon payment of the requisite charges. The claimant may where necessary, seek further information or clarification from the health care provider on any aspect of the report and the health care provider should respond within 4 weeks from receipt of such further request.

2.8. If the health care provider has difficulty complying with the timeline prescribed above, the problem and reason for the difficulty must be explained to the claimant in writing and the necessary extension of time sought.

2.9. If the health care provider fails to provide the requisite medical report, medical records and/or clarification within the timelines prescribed above or agreed extension period, the claimant may proceed to apply to the Court for an order for production before action under Order 11, Rule 11 of the Rules of Court 2021, without further notice to the health care provider. The Court will take into account any unreasonable delay in providing the said medical report, medical records and/or clarification when considering the issue of costs.

### **PART TWO: COMMENCEMENT OF SUIT AND PROCEEDINGS BEFORE TRIAL**

### 3. **Application**

3.1. Part Two of the Protocol relates to the commencement of proceedings for medical negligence claims and the procedures before trial undertaken in such cases.

### 4. **Filing of medical reports and lists of documents**

4.1. A claimant commencing a medical negligence claim in Court is required to file and serve the main documents relied on in support of the claim including expert report(s) together with the Statement of Claim.

4.2.The defendant is also required to file and serve a medical report within 6 weeks after the filing of the notice of intention to contest. 

4.3.For cases that are subject to the simplified process under Order 65 of the Rules of Court 2021 (Magistrates' Courts cases filed on or after 1 April 2022 and by consent, District Courts cases filed on or after 1 April 2022), each party is required to file and serve a list of documents together with the relevant pleading on the other party within the time limited for the service of such pleading under Order 65, Rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court 2021.

4.4. For cases that are not subject to the simplified process, if there are documents other than the medical report filed with a claimant's pleading and the medical report that will be filed by a defendant under paragraph 4.2, that party is required to file and serve a list of documents on the other party within 6 weeks after the filing of the notice of intention to contest using [Form 10](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A2/Form%2010.pdf) of Appendix A2 to these Practice Directions.

### **5. Steps to be taken after pleadings have been filed and served**

5.1. In order to encourage parties to delineate undisputed facts and issues at an early stage, parties are required to file a list of undisputed facts and issues 2 weeks after the pleadings have been filed and served or as directed by the Court.

5.2. Currently, a party may make an admission of fact in his or her pleadings or other documents under Order 9, Rule 18(2) of the Rules of Court 2021. To avoid doubt, the same applies to medical negligence claims.

### **6. Court Dispute Resolution Case Conference**

6.1. For all medical negligence cases that are filed in Court, the Court will convene the first Court Dispute Resolution Case Conference (“CDR CC”) under Order 9 of the Rules of Court 2021 within 6 weeks after the filing of the notice of intention to contest. 

6.2. At the first CDR CC, parties will explore the possibility of resolving the case by mediation, neutral evaluation, conciliation or other forms of Court ADR under the prevailing framework. Solicitors for all parties seeking an early neutral evaluation on liability must file submissions as directed by the Court at the CDR CC. Whether or not an evaluation on liability is given, the Court may, at its own discretion in appropriate cases or at solicitors' request, provide an evaluation on quantum. Solicitors requesting for an evaluation on quantum must obtain each other's consent before the CDR CC, and submit the duly completed Quantum Neutral Evaluation Form (*ie*, [Form 11](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2011.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions) to the Court.

6.3. No directions for production of documents will be given as most documents would have been produced at the pre-action stage and in the pleadings. However, parties may apply for a broader scope of discovery as provided for under the Rules of Court 2021.

6.4. The Court may, where appropriate, appoint a medical professional to co mediate at the Court ADR hearing. 

### 7. Compliance with the Protocol

7.1. In the interest of saving time and costs, claimants are expected to use this protocol as a checklist on the required steps to be taken before commencing Court proceedings and during pre-trial proceedings. Parties must comply with the terms of the Protocol in substance and spirit. A breach by one party will not exempt the other parties in the claim from following the Protocol insofar as they are able.

7.2. In exercising its discretion and powers, the Court will have regard to compliance with this protocol or lack thereof, including staying an action for the party in default to comply with the protocol, and in determining the amount of costs to be awarded.

7.3. Where there are good reasons for non-compliance, the Court will not impose sanctions against the party in default.
