## APPENDIX C: Guidelines for Court Dispute Resolution Case Conferences for Personal Injury Claims and Non-Injury Motor Accident Claims

### 1. **Introduction**

1.1. Pursuant to Practice Direction 39, all personal injury claims and non-injury motor accident ("**NIMA**") claims are to proceed for a Court Dispute Resolution Case Conference ("**CDR CC**") within 6 weeks after the notice of intention to contest has been filed. The CDR CC will be conducted through the process set out in the State Courts Registrar’s Circular No. 2 of 2020. 

1.2. Early neutral evaluation ("**ENE**") will be used in the CDR CC for these cases. This Appendix sets out the guidelines to be followed by solicitors. 

### 2. **Application**

2.1. The guidelines in this Appendix shall apply to all Originating Claims for personal injury claims and NIMA claims that are filed in Court on or after 1 April 2022 and to all motor accident cases (whether or not involving any claim for personal injuries) and actions for personal injuries arising out of an industrial accident that are commenced in the High Court on or after 1 April 2022 and transferred to the District Courts.

### 3. **Date of CDR CC**

3.1. As stated in Practice Direction 39(12), solicitors in these cases will receive a notice from the Court fixing the first CDR CC.
 
3.2. A request for an adjournment of a CDR CC shall be made in the manner provided in the notice from the Court fixing the CDR CC.
 
3.3. The applicant must obtain the consent of the other parties to the adjournment and list the dates that are unsuitable for all the parties. 

3.4. The request must be made *not less than 2 working days* before the date of the CDR CC. An adjournment of a CDR CC will be granted only for good reason.

### 4. **Attendance at CDR CC**

4.1. The Court retains the discretion to direct the personal attendance of counsel and parties at the CDR CC where it is necessary in the circumstances of the case. For instance, the drivers of the vehicles involved in a motor accident and eyewitnesses may be asked to be present at a CDR CC for the purpose of a more accurate ENE or to facilitate in negotiating a settlement. 

### 5. **Preparation for CDR CC**

5.1. In all personal injury claims and NIMA claims, solicitors should exchange before the first CDR CC, a list of all the relevant documents relating to both liability and quantum.

5.2. In addition, solicitors should exchange all documents they intend to rely upon or which are known to be adverse in the following categories before the first CDR CC.

>(a) For **personal injury claims or where personal injury forms part of the motor accident claim** — 

>>(i) medical reports from the treating doctor, reviewing doctor and medical specialist; 

>>(ii) certificates for hospitalisation and medical leave; 

>>(iii) bills for medical treatment and evidence of payment;

>>(iv) income tax notices of assessment and/or other evidence of income and loss thereof, if relevant; and

>>(v) supporting documents for all other expenses claimed (if any). 


>(b) For **industrial accident claims** —

>>(i) the parties’ sketches of the accident (if any);

>>(ii) notice of accident lodged with the Ministry of Manpower;

>>(iii) Ministry of Manpower’s investigation reports (if any);

>>(iv) Notice of Assessment from the Occupational Safety and Health Division, Ministry of Manpower (if any);

>>(v) outcome of prosecution (if any);

>>(vi) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene;

>>(vii) video recording of the accident (if any);

>>(viii) details of witnesses (if any); and

>>(ix) any other supporting documents.

>(c) For **personal injury claims not involving motor accidents or industrial accidents**, 

>>(i) the parties' sketches of the accident (if any);

>>(ii) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene;

>>(iii) video recording of the accident (if any); 

>>(iv) details of witnesses (if any); and

>>(v) any other supporting documents.

>(d) For **NIMA claims**

>>(i) full and complete Singapore Accident Statements and police reports including the names, details of all persons involved in the accident, together with type-written transcripts of their factual accounts of the accident; 

>>(ii) police sketch plan and if unavailable, the parties’ sketches of the accident; 

>>(iii) results of police investigations or outcome of prosecution for traffic offence(s); 

>>(iv) police vehicle damage reports; 

>>(v) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of damage to all vehicles; 

>>(vi) original, coloured copies or scanned photographs of the accident scene; 

>>(vii) video recording of the accident (if any);

>>(viii) accident reconstruction report (if any);

>>(ix) details of witnesses (if any); 

>>(x) repairer’s bill and evidence of payment; 

>>(xi) surveyor’s report; 

>>(xii) excess bill or receipt; 

>>(xiii) vehicle registration card; 

>>(xiv) COE/PARF certificates; 

>>(xv) rental agreement, invoice and receipt for rental of replacement vehicle (if any);

>>(xvi) correspondences with the defendant’s insurer relating to pre-repair survey and/or post-repair inspection of the claimant's vehicle; and

>>(xvii) any other supporting documents. 

5.3. **_Additional documents and instructions_**

>(a) If any *additional* documents apart from those referred to in paragraph 5.2 are required, this shall be made known to the other party well before the first CDR CC date. If a re-inspection of the other party's vehicle is required, it should be conducted and the report exchanged before the first CDR CC.

>(b) It is very important that solicitors take *full and complete* instructions from their respective clients before attending the CDR CC. Before the CDR CC, solicitors should evaluate with their clients the documents and reports and advise their clients on all the relevant aspects of their case. 

>(c) Where a party is relying on the factual account of any witness in support of his case, a signed statement or affidavit of evidence-in-chief should be procured from that witness and submitted to the Court at the first CDR CC to enable the Court to be fully apprised of all the relevant evidence. 

>(d) Insurers should notify their solicitors if, to their knowledge, other claims arising from the same accident have been filed in Court. Solicitors should assist the Court in identifying these related claims so that all the claims may be dealt with together at the CDR CC for a consistent outcome on liability. If an ENE on liability has been given or interlocutory judgment has been entered in any related claim(s), solicitors should notify the Court accordingly and endeavour to resolve the remaining claims(s) on the same basis.

>(e) Third party proceedings, if any, should be commenced before the first CDR CC. 

5.4. To make the full use of the CDR CC, it is essential that solicitors be well prepared and familiar with their cases. 

### 6. **CDR CC** 

>**_Claims subject to the simplified process under Order 65 of the Rules of Court 2021_**

6.1. All cases commenced by Originating Claims on or after 1 April 2022 in a Magistrate's Court and any case commenced by Originating Claims on or after 1 April 2022 in a District Court (where parties have filed their consent in [Form 3](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%203.pdf) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions for Order 65 to apply) will be subject to the simplified process under Order 65 of the Rules of Court 2021.

6.2. The requirement for upfront production under Order 65, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court 2021 apply to such cases. 

6.3. These claims will continue to be called for CDR CC within 6 weeks after the filing of the notice of intention to contest. The rest of the guidelines in Appendix C also apply to CDR CCs for these claims.

6.4. If the matter is not disposed of by the Court or settled or otherwise resolved through the actions of the parties in the course of the CDR CC process, the Court may make such orders or give such directions as it thinks fit including directions for the filing and exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief, appointment of a single joint expert (for actions commenced in the Magistrates' Courts) and any other necessary directions to bring the proceedings to trial.

6.5. Where any question requiring the evidence of an expert witness arises and parties are unable to agree on the expert to be appointed, the Court may, having regard to the provisions in Order 12, Rule 3(5) of the Rules of Court 2021, appoint the expert for the parties at a CDR CC. Each party is expected to furnish the following for the determination of the single joint expert:

>(a) names and *curriculum vitae* of two experts the party considers suitable to appoint (for which purpose a party may nominate the expert who has conducted an inspection, survey or review for him or provided him with medical treatment);

>(b) the fees charged by each nominated expert for preparing the report and attendance in Court;

>(c) the estimated time needed to prepare the report; and

>(d) whether the parties have complied with the pre-action protocol.

The Court will appoint the single joint expert after hearing submissions on the suitability or unsuitability of the nominated experts to be appointed.

**_Early Neutral Evaluation on liability and quantum_**

6.6. For personal injury arising out of motor accident ("**PIMA**") claims and NIMA claims, the Court will provide an ENE on liability if — 

>(a) the factual matrix of the particular motor accident does not correspond substantially with any of the scenarios set out in the *Motor Accident Claims Online, Motor Accident Guide* and/or other similar guide; or

>(b) despite the parties' reasonable efforts in resolving the question of liability through negotiation with reference to the *Motor Accident Claims Online, Motor Accident Guide* and/or other similar guide before the CDR CC, no settlement has been reached.

6.7. Solicitors for all the parties seeking an ENE on liability in PIMA and NIMA claims must prepare a submission with relevant supporting documents for the first CDR CC. Except in cases where no corresponding scenario is provided for in the *Motor Accident Claims Online, Motor Accident Guide* and/or other similar guide solicitors must specify in their submissions the scenario(s) that is/are relevant to the parties’ factual accounts of the accident and state their respective proposals on liability.

6.8	In respect of personal injury claims, whether or not an ENE on liability is given, the Court may, at its own discretion in appropriate cases or at solicitors' request, provide an ENE on quantum. Solicitors requesting for an ENE on quantum must obtain each other’s consent before the CDR CC, and submit the duly completed Quantum Neutral Evaluation Form (*ie*, [Form 11](https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A1/Form%2011.pdf)) of Appendix A1 to these Practice Directions) to the Court. 

### 7. **Help and co-operation of insurers in facilitating CDR**

7.1. Insurers play a key role in the success of CDR. A CDR CC is intended for substantive evaluation of the issues. CDR CC is unproductive if: 

>(a) parties have not —

>>(i) exchanged the relevant documents listed in paragraph 5; or

>>(ii) identified the scenario(s) in the *Motor Accident Claims Online, Motor Accident Guide* and/or other similar guide that is/are relevant to their respective factual accounts of the accident

>well before the CDR CC to facilitate assessment and discussion of options; 

>(b) one or more of the solicitors for the parties have not received or are still taking client’s instructions; or 

>(c) parties are still negotiating or are awaiting instructions upon a counter-offer. 

### 8. **Follow up action after CDR CC**

8.1. Solicitors must inform their clients of the outcome of a CDR CC and render their advice expeditiously on the ENE on liability and/or quantum given by the Court. To facilitate settlement, solicitors should obtain their clients’ instructions and make the necessary proposals or offers of settlement early to enable the other party to consider their position or proposal and respond before the next CDR CC date. Reasons shall be given by parties for the position taken on liability and/or quantum so that the solicitors can inform the Court of the basis for their clients’ mandate at the next CDR CC.

8.2. Rather than refraining from taking a position on liability or insisting that agreement on liability is *contingent* on quantum being settled at a particular sum (as is sometimes the case), parties who are able to agree on the issue of liability but not quantum shall consider allowing an *Interlocutory Judgment* to be recorded for liability and proceed for assessment of damages. A hearing to assess damages is generally less costly than a full trial.
