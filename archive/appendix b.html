<h3 id="1-application">1. <strong>Application</strong></h3>

<p>1.1. The object of this protocol is to streamline the management of personal injury claims and non-injury motor accident claims (“<strong>PI/NIMA claims</strong>”) and promote early settlement of such claims. It prescribes a framework for negotiation and exchange of information before commencing proceedings.</p>

<p>1.2. This protocol applies to actions arising out of:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a) all personal injury claims including —</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) claims arising out of motor accidents and industrial accidents;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(ii) personal injury claims (arising out of claims in negligence); and</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(iii) claims arising from fatal accidents,</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>where it is contemplated that action will be commenced on or after 1 April 2022 in the Magistrates;; Courts or the District Courts, as the case may be, but does not apply to medical negligence claims; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) all personal injury claims arising out of motor accidents (whether or not involving any claim for property damage arising out of the same accident) and industrial accidents where it is contemplated that action will be commenced on or after 1 April 2022 in the High Court (and subsequently transferred to the District Courts).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) non-injury motor accidents where it is contemplated that action will be commenced on or after:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) 1 April 2022 with the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd (“<strong>FIDReC</strong>”) or in the Magistrates’; Courts or the District Courts, as the case may be; and</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(ii) 1 April 2022 in the High Court (and subsequently transferred to the District Courts).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>1.3. Any reference to “the potential defendant” in this protocol refers to the potential defendant if he is not claiming under his insurance policy, or to his insurer if he is claiming under his policy.</p>

<p>1.4. Any reference to an “insurer” in this protocol refers to an insurer that is known or could be reasonably known to the claimant or his solicitors.</p>

<p>1.5. This protocol does not affect any privilege that may apply to any communication between the parties that is undertaken in compliance with it.</p>

<p>1.6. This protocol encourages the parties to jointly select medical experts before commencing proceedings.</p>

<h3 id="2-notice-of-accident-and-pre-repair-survey-applicable-only-to-nima-claims">2. <strong>Notice of Accident and Pre-Repair Survey (applicable only to NIMA claims)</strong></h3>

<p>2.1. Time is of the essence in the joint selection of a motor surveyor and the conduct of a pre-repair survey of the claimant’;s vehicle.</p>

<p>2.2. Within <strong>3 working days</strong> of the date of the accident, the claimant must send a notice of accident to the potential defendant and his insurer (or where there is a multi-party collision, to each of the potential defendants and his insurer). This is to facilitate a joint survey of the damage to the claimant’;s vehicle prior to the commencement of repairs (“<strong>pre-repair survey</strong>”). The pre-repair survey will include a survey of the vehicle when its damaged parts are being dismantled prior to the commencement of repairs.</p>

<p>2.3. Within <strong>2 working days</strong> of receipt of the notice of accident, the insurer must reply to the claimant and if he intends to conduct a pre-repair survey of the claimant’;s damaged vehicle, he must include in his reply a list of at least three motor surveyors.</p>

<p>2.4. Within <strong>2 working days</strong> of receipt of the insurer’;s reply, the claimant must reply to the insurer stating whether he agrees or has any objections to the appointment of any of the motor surveyors proposed by the insurer. The claimant may specifically select one or more of the proposed motor surveyors. If the claimant fails to reply or fails in his reply to object to any of the motor surveyors listed by the insurer within the time stipulated by this paragraph, the claimant is deemed to have agreed to the appointment of any of the motor surveyors listed by the insurer.</p>

<p>2.5. If the claimant objects to all the motor surveyors proposed by the insurer, he must include in his reply a list of at least three motor surveyors whom he considers as suitable to appoint.</p>

<p>2.6. Within <strong>2 working days</strong> of receipt of the claimant’;s list of proposed motor surveyors, the insurer must state whether he agrees or has any objections to any of the motor surveyors proposed by the claimant. The insurer may specifically select one or more of the proposed motor surveyors. If the insurer fails to reply or fails in his reply to object to any of the motor surveyors listed by the claimant within the time stipulated by this paragraph, the insurer is deemed to have agreed to the appointment of any of the motor surveyors listed by the claimant.</p>

<p>2.7. The motor surveyor mutually agreed upon by both parties or presumed to be agreed by the claimant or the insurer (as the case may be) shall be referred to as the “ <strong>single joint expert</strong>”. Upon reaching such agreement, the insurer must <strong>immediately</strong> instruct the single joint expert to conduct the pre-repair survey. Alternatively, upon the expiry of the time stipulated for the claimant/insurer to object to the motor surveyors proposed by the other party and he fails to do so, the insurer/claimant must <strong>immediately</strong> instruct the single joint expert to conduct the pre-repair survey. The single joint expert instructed by the insurer or the claimant (as the case may be) must complete the pre-repair survey within <strong>2 working days</strong> of his appointment.</p>

<p>2.8. If the insurer objects to all the motor surveyors proposed by the claimant, both parties are not precluded from instructing a motor surveyor of their own choice to conduct the pre-repair survey. In such event, the motor surveyor appointed by the insurer must complete the pre-repair survey for the insurer within <strong>2 working days</strong> from the date of the insurer’;s reply objecting to all the motor surveyors proposed by the claimant. If the quantum of the potential claim is likely to be within the Magistrate’;s Court limit, parties are to be aware of Order 12, Rule 3(5) of the Rules of Court 2021 on the appointment of a single joint expert should the matter be unresolved subsequently and proceed for a simplified trial. Both parties shall in any event not unreasonably withhold consent to the appointment of a single joint expert as far as possible.</p>

<p>2.9. Once the pre-repair survey has been conducted, the claimant and the insurer shall negotiate and, as far as possible, come to an agreement on the cost of repairing the claimant’;s vehicle.</p>

<p>2.10. If parties are unable to come to an agreement on the cost of repairing the vehicle after negotiations, the claimant may proceed to repair his vehicle. The insurer may wish to request for an opportunity to conduct a post repair inspection once the vehicle has been repaired. The request should be made as soon as possible and before the repaired vehicle is returned to the claimant.</p>

<h3 id="3-letter-of-claim">3. <strong>Letter of Claim</strong></h3>

<p>3.1. The claimant must send a letter of claim to every potential defendant and his insurer.</p>

<p>3.2. The letter of claim must set out the full particulars of his claim, including the following information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) a brief statement of all the relevant and available facts on which the claim is based;</p>

  <p>(b) a brief description of the nature of the property damage and/or injuries suffered;</p>

If the claimant in a personal injury claim is non-resident in Singapore, the letter of claim must further state the date the claimant is required to depart from Singapore once the relevant permits expire or are cancelled and, where available, the date of his intended departure from Singapore. This is to afford the potential defendant or his insurer an opportunity to arrange for a medical examination of the claimant by a medical expert mutually agreed by both parties in each relevant specialty, or where there is no agreement, a medical re-examination of the claimant by a medical expert appointed by the potential defendant or his insurer prior to the claimant’;s departure from Singapore.</p>

<p>3.6. The claimant must enclose with his letter of claim a list of all the documents he intends to rely upon or which are known to be adverse relating to both liability and quantum.</p>

  <p>(j) if, to the claimant’;s knowledge, the insurer had waived the requirement for pre-repair survey and/or post-repair inspection of the vehicle, he should state so accordingly in the letter of claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3.8. Where the claim is for both personal injury and property damage arising out of a motor accident (a “ <strong>mixed claim</strong>”), the claimant is to enclose all the documents set out in paragraph 3.7.</p>

<p>3.9. The letter of claim must also instruct the potential defendant to immediately pass the letter and the documents to his insurer if he wishes to claim under his insurance policy. If the potential defendant’;s insurer is known to the claimant, a copy of the letter of claim must be sent directly to the insurer.

<p>4.2. The claimant must reply within <strong>7 days</strong> of receipt of the letter of request. Where valid reasons are given by the insurer, the parties shall as far as possible, agree on the arrangements for the post-repair inspection so as to facilitate an amicable resolution of the claim as soon as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Acknowledgment letter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4.3. The potential defendant must send an acknowledgement letter to the claimant within <strong>14 days</strong> from the date of receipt of the letter of claim. If he is ready to take a position on the claim, he must state his position. If not, he must first send an acknowledgement.</p>

<p>4.4. If the claimant does not receive an acknowledgement letter from the potential defendant within the requisite <strong>14 days</strong> , he may commence proceedings without any sanction by the Court.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) If the potential defendant agrees to any of the proposed medical experts, the claimant shall send the medical expert in each of the relevant specialty a letter of appointment within <strong>14 days</strong>. The medical expert mutually agreed upon by both parties shall be referred to as the “single joint expert”.</p>

  <p>(b) The letter of appointment must be copied to the potential defendant.</p>

  <p>(c) If the potential defendant objects to all the proposed medical experts for any relevant specialty, the potential defendant must state the reasons for his objections and provide the name(s) of one or more medical experts in each relevant specialty whom he considers as suitable to appoint. The claimant shall within <strong>14 days</strong> from the date of receipt of the letter from the potential defendant state if he has any objections to the appointment of any of the medical experts proposed by the potential defendant for the relevant specialty.</p>

  <p>(d) If the claimant agrees to any of the proposed medical experts, the claimant shall send the medical expert in each of the relevant specialty a letter of appointment within <strong>14 days.</strong> The medical expert mutually agreed upon by both parties shall be referred to as the “single joint expert”.</p>

  <p>(e) The letter of appointment must be copied to the potential defendant.</p>

  <p>(f) If the potential defendant or claimant fails to reply or fails in his reply to object to any of the medical experts listed in the other party’;s letter within the timeline stipulated by this protocol, the party who fails to reply or to object is deemed to have agreed to the appointment of any of the medical experts proposed by the other party as a single joint expert.</p>

  <p>(g) The costs of the medical examination of the claimant and medical report to be provided by the single joint expert shall be paid first by the claimant who may seek to recover the cost as part of his claim for reasonable disbursements.</p>

  <p>(h) Either party may send the single joint expert written questions relevant to the issues or matters on which the medical report is sought. The questions must be copied to the other party.</p>

  <p>(i) If the claimant objects to the medical experts proposed by the potential defendant for any relevant specialty, both parties are not precluded from instructing medical experts of their own choice for each relevant specialty that the parties are unable to agree upon. Should the potential defendant wish to arrange for the claimant to undergo a medical examination by his own medical expert, the potential defendant shall within <strong>14 days</strong> from the date of receipt of the claimant’;s letter of reply, propose a date and time on which the claimant is to undergo the medical examination. The address at which the claimant must present himself for the medical examination must also be provided. However, if the estimated quantum falls within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate’;s Court, parties are to be aware of Order 12, Rule 3(5) of the Rules of Court 2021 on the appointment of a single joint expert should the matter be unresolved subsequently and proceed for a simplified trial. Both parties shall in any event not unreasonably withhold consent to the appointment of a single joint expert as far as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Substantive reply to claimant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4.6. If the potential defendant replies to the claimant with only an acknowledgement of receipt, within <strong>8 weeks</strong> from the date of receipt of the letter of claim or within <strong>14 days</strong> after inspecting the vehicle, whichever is later, the potential defendant must reply to the claimant substantively. For this purpose, the following provisions will apply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The reply shall indicate whether the insurer is defending the claim or whether the defendant is defending the claim personally. Reasons for the insurer’;s decision not to act must be provided.</p>

  <p>(b)Subject to sub-paragraph (d) below, the reply must state the potential defendant’;s position on the claim on both liability and quantum (<em>eg</em>, whether the claim is admitted or denied) or make an offer of settlement. If the claim is not admitted in full, the potential defendant must give reasons and provide a list of documents together with copies of all relevant supporting documents. The potential defendant is to confirm/state the identity of the person driving his vehicle at the time of the accident and provide the driver’;s identification number and address if this is not already stated in the Singapore Accident Statement.</p>

  <p>(f) If the insurer is the party replying to the claimant, the reply must also state the name(s), telephone number(s) and fax number(s) of the insurance officer(s) handling the matter and the insurer’;s file reference number(s), to facilitate correspondence.</p>

  <p>(g) Pending the receipt of the medical report or other medical expert appointed under paragraph 4.5 (as the case may be), the reply must state the potential defendant’;s position on liability and his preliminary position on quantum or, if he is unable to do so, reserve his position on quantum. Within <strong>14 days</strong> of receipt of the medical report from the medical expert and/or the vehicle inspection report, the potential defendant must state his position on quantum (<em>eg</em>, whether the quantum claimed is admitted or denied) or make an offer of settlement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4.7. If the claimant does not receive the potential defendant’;s substantive reply to his letter of claim within the requisite timeframe stipulated in paragraph 4.6, he may commence proceedings without any sanction by the Court.</p>

<p>4.8. The letter of claim and the responses are not intended to have the effect of pleadings in an action.</p>

<h3 id="5-counterclaim">5. <strong>Counterclaim</strong></h3>

<p>5.1. If the potential defendant has a counterclaim, he must include it in his reply, giving full particulars of the counterclaim together with all relevant supporting documents. If the potential defendant is pursuing his counterclaim separately, <em>ie</em>, his insurer is only handling his defence but not his counterclaim, the potential defendant must send a letter to the claimant giving full particulars of the counterclaim together with all relevant supporting documents within <strong>8 weeks</strong> from receipt of the letter of claim. If the potential defendant has already furnished particulars in a separate letter of claim, he need only refer to that letter of claim in his reply.</p>

<p>5.2. Where the counterclaim includes a personal injury, paragraphs 3 and 4 above shall apply with the necessary modifications.</p>

<p>5.3. The letter of claim and the responses are not intended to have the effect of pleadings in the action.</p>

This letter must be copied to the claimant.</p>

<p>6.2. The protocol set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 is applicable to the third party or, if he is claiming under his insurance policy, his insurer, as though the potential defendant were the claimant and the third party, or his insurer as the case may be, were the potential defendant.</p>

<h3 id="7-fourth-parties">7. <strong>Fourth parties</strong></h3>

<p>7.1. Paragraph 6 shall apply with the necessary modifications to fourth party proceedings and so on. All correspondences between the parties must be copied to all the other parties involved in the accident.</p>

<h3 id="8-potential-defendant-to-bear-claimants-loss-of-use-arising-from-pre-repair-survey-andor-post-repair-inspection">8. <strong>Potential defendant to bear claimant’;s loss of use arising from pre-repair survey and/or post-repair inspection</strong></h3>

<p>8.1.

  <p>(a) the pre-repair survey is completed and he may proceed to repair his vehicle; or</p>

  <p>(b) the insurer is waiving the requirement for pre-repair survey and he may proceed to repair his vehicle,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>as the case may be, inclusive of any intervening Saturday, Sunday or public holiday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>8.2. Where the insurer fails to respond to the claimant within <strong>2</strong>** working days <strong>of receipt of the notice of accident as to whether he wishes to carry out or waive a pre-repair survey, the claimant may proceed to repair the vehicle and the potential defendant must compensate the claimant for the loss of use of his vehicle computed over</strong> 2 working days**, inclusive of any intervening Saturday, Sunday or public holiday.</p>

<p>8.3. For avoidance of doubt, the compensation payable to the claimant for loss of use in the instances set out in paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 is additional to any other claim for loss of use which the claimant may bring against the potential defendant.</p>

<p>8.4. Where an insurer requests for post-repair inspection pursuant to paragraph 4.1, the potential defendant must compensate the claimant for the loss of use of his vehicle for the day that the inspection is conducted.</p>

<p>9.1. Subject to any litigation privilege, any party who receives a medical report from his medical expert or the single joint expert must within <strong>7 days</strong> of its receipt send a copy of the report to every other party. For the avoidance of doubt, these are medical reports which the parties intend to rely on for the purpose of litigation and neither party need disclose to the other medical reports (if any) that he is not relying on.</p>

Litigation should not be commenced prematurely if there are reasonable prospects for a settlement.</p>

<p>11.2. If, after reasonable effort has been made to settle the matter, but there are no reasonable prospects of settlement after a time period of <strong>at least 8 weeks</strong> from the date of receipt of the letter of claim, save where paragraphs 4.4 or 4.7 apply, the claimant may commence legal action after giving <strong>10 clear days’;</strong> notice, by e-mail, fax or certificate of posting to the potential defendant and his insurer of his intention to proceed with an originating claim. He must also inform the potential defendant of the names of all the parties he is suing. No such notice is required if the claimant had earlier given notice that the offer being made was final, and legal proceedings would be commenced in the event that the potential defendant did not accept the offer within the specified timeframe.</p>

<h3 id="12-interim-payment">12. <strong>Interim payment</strong></h3>

<p>12.1. The claimant may in his letter of claim or in a letter sent at any time subsequent thereto, seek one or more pre-action interim payment(s) of damages from the potential defendant. The claimant must state in his letter —</p>

Unless the claimant states otherwise, any sum which the potential defendant offers as an interim payment, regardless as to whether the request is acceded to in full or in part, shall be paid to the claimant within <strong>28 days</strong> of the potential defendant’;s reply.</p>

<h3 id="13-costs-guidelines">13. <strong>Costs Guidelines</strong></h3>

      <tr>
        <th><strong>Sum settled</strong> <strong>(excluding interest if any)</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Costs allowed</strong> <strong>(exclusive of disbursements)</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$10,000 and above</td>
        <td>$500 to $1,000</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>PI claims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>13.1. As a guide, where the sum settled (excluding interest if any) is less than $20,000, the pre-trial costs should be between $1,500 and $2,500, exclusive of disbursements.</p>

<p>14.1. Where the claimant has without good reason repaired or caused repairs to be carried out to his vehicle without first complying with paragraph 2 of this protocol in relation to pre-repair survey, then on account of the omission, the Court may impose costs sanctions against the claimant.</p>

<p>14.2. Where the defendant disputes the damage to the claimant’;s vehicle and after the commencement of Court proceedings requests for an inspection of the claimant’;s vehicle without good reason, the Court may impose costs sanctions against the defendant.</p>

<h3 id="15-exceptions">15. <strong>Exceptions</strong></h3>

<p>15.1. The Court will not impose sanctions where there are good reasons for non-compliance with the provisions of this protocol, for example attempt(s) made to resolve the claim through other alternative dispute resolution forums.</p>

<p>15.2. The protocol prescribes the timelines to be given to a potential defendant to investigate and respond to a claim before proceedings are commenced. This may not always be possible where a claimant only consults his lawyer close to the end of any relevant limitation period. In such a case, the claimant must give as much notice of the intention to commence proceedings as practicable and the parties shall consider whether the Court might be invited to extend time for service of the pleadings or alternatively, to stay the proceedings while the requirements of this protocol are being complied with.</p>

<h3 id="16-early-agreement-on-liability">16. <strong>Early agreement on liability</strong></h3>

<p>16.1. Where parties have agreed on the issue of liability prior to the commencement of proceedings and wish to issue an originating claim in order for damages to be assessed, the claimant must file an originating claim endorsed with a simplified statement of claim. If a notice of intention to contest is not filed and served after the originating claim is served, the claimant may, in the manner prescribed under the Rules of Court 2021, proceed to enter default interlocutory judgment and take out an application for directions for the assessment of damages.</p>

<p>17.2. Unless the case falls within one or more of the exceptions listed in paragraph 18 of this protocol, the claimant shall in every case referred to in paragraph 17.1, lodge his claim with FIDReC at first instance. Upon lodgement, the claim shall be dealt with by FIDReC in accordance with its Terms of Reference relating to the management and resolution of such claims.</p>

<p>17.3. Notwithstanding that the claim is to be lodged with FIDReC, the claimant and potential defendant shall comply with the requirements of this protocol. In this connection, references to the “Court”, originating claim/Court action and proceedings in this protocol shall refer to “FIDReC”, the lodgement of a claim at FIDReC and proceedings at FIDReC respectively.</p>

<h3 id="18-exceptions-to-fidrec-proceedings">18. <strong>Exceptions to FIDReC proceedings</strong></h3>

<p>18.1. In any case where –</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the claimant is a body corporate or partnership;</p>

  <p>(b)one or more of the vehicles involved in the accident is a government, a foreign-registered or diplomatic vehicle;</p>

  <p>(c) the potential defendant has a counterclaim of $3,000 or more;</p>

  <p>(e) the insurer for the claim or counterclaim has repudiated liability;</p>

  <p>(f) an allegation that the claim, counterclaim or defence is tainted by fraud or other conduct constituting a criminal offence in connection with which a police report has been lodged;</p>

  <p>(g) proceedings are still ongoing at FIDReC after a lapse of 6 months from the date when all the relevant documents pertaining to the accident that were requested by FIDReC have been submitted or, from the date of the claimant’;s first interview at FIDReC, whichever is later; or</p>

  <p>(h) there is other good and sufficient reason shown to the Court why the claim ought not to have been lodged at FIDReC or the proceedings ought not to have continued at FIDReC,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the claimant may commence an action in Court directly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="19-costs-sanctions-for-non-compliance-with-requirement-to-lodge-the-claimcontinue-with-proceedings-at-fidrec">19. <strong>Costs sanctions for non-compliance with requirement to lodge the claim/continue with proceedings at FIDReC</strong></h3>

<p>19.1. Where the claimant in a case to which paragraph 17.1 of this protocol applies, has commenced an action in Court, the Court in exercising its discretion as to costs, shall have regard to the following, where applicable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) commencement of Court proceedings before adjudication of the claim by FIDReC;</p>

  <p>(b) a finding by the Court that the quantum of damages before apportionment of liability is below $3,000 excluding survey fees, interests, costs and disbursements and the damages quantified and pleaded in the Statement of Claim is for an amount exceeding $3,000; or</p>

  <p>(c) the claimant has failed to obtain a judgment that is more favourable than the award made at the adjudication of the claim by FIDReC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>19.2. The Court will not impose sanctions on the claimant where there are good reasons for non-compliance, for example attempt(s) made to resolve the claim through other alternative dispute resolution forums.</p>

<h3 id="20-application-of-the-limitation-act-cap-163">20. <strong>Application of the Limitation Act (Cap 163)</strong></h3>

<p>20.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the lodgement of a claim and/or continuation of proceedings at FIDReC shall not be construed to operate as a stay of the time limited for the doing of any act as prescribed by the Limitation Act (Cap 163).</p>

<p>20.2. Should Court proceedings be commenced to prevent the operation of the time bar under the Limitation Act (Cap 163), the Court may nevertheless stay the action thereafter to enable the claimant to lodge his claim and/or complete the proceedings at FIDReC.</p>
