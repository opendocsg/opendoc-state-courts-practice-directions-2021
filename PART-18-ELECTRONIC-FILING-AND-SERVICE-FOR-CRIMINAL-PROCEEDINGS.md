## 122. Documents for use in criminal trials

(1) The party intending to tender a document as evidence to the Court during a trial must file an electronic copy of the document.

(5) The importance of not submitting unnecessarily large electronic files is emphasised. If there are a large number of documents to be tendered, parties should submit an electronic copy of the documents stored on a CD-ROM instead of electronically filing the documents. These documents will be uploaded into the case file by the Court officer and will form part of the electronic case file. 

(6) Parties may obtain directions of the Case Conference or Criminal Case Disclosure Conference Court or trial Court if they are uncertain if the documents should be electronically filed, submitted on a CD-ROM or tendered by hard copy.

>(a) all necessary amendments must be made to the charge that is to be tendered to the Court, so as to remove references to all information (*eg*, details of a witness) as are necessary to comply with the terms of the gag order that was granted;

>(b) where an amendment is made to the original charge in line with sub-paragraph (a) above, a copy of the charge so amended (hereafter referred to as the “redacted charge”) must be uploaded into the ICMS in the Redacted Document tab in accordance with the steps as set out in Illustration I in Appendix G to these Practice Directions;
