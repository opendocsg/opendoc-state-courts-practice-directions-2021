The solicitor will then be asked to attend before the Registrar for directions to be given on how the documents should be filed.


## 87. Form of documents

(1) It is not necessary for documents that are electronically filed in Court to have a cover page or backing sheet.

(2) Parties are reminded that they must, at all times, ensure that the information stored in the front-end system is up-to-date and free from errors as the same information will be reproduced in the electronic forms that are generated by the Electronic Filing Service. 

(3) Documents generated by the Electronic Filing Service containing out-of-date or wrong information will be rejected by the Registry and the fee payable shall be that stipulated in the Fourth Schedule of the Rules of Court 2021. 

(4) In the event that the Electronic Filing Service fails to automatically generate an information page, parties may undertake the procedure outlined in Practice Direction 90(2).


## 88. Pagination of documents

Every single page of a document *must* be paginated so that the pagination on the actual document corresponds with the pagination of the document in the electronic case file. This is to facilitate hearings involving documents.


## 89. Documents which cannot be converted into an electronic format

(1) If a document cannot be converted in whole or in part into an electronic format for any reason, the hardcopy of the document must be filed at the Registry of the State Courts.

(2) If the Court receives a document which the filing party says cannot be converted in whole or part into an electronic format, and it can discern no good reason why the document cannot be wholly converted into an electronic format, the document may be rejected. 


## 90. Rejection of documents, back-dating and refund of penalty

(1) Care must be taken to enter correct, complete and accurate information into the electronic form. If the information entered into the electronic form and the actual document differ, the document is likely to be rejected by the Court. If a document is rejected by the Court for any reason, a penalty may nonetheless be payable in respect of the document as specified in the Fourth Schedule of the Rules of Court 2021. In this regard, solicitors’ attention is also drawn to Order 28, Rule 16 of the Rules of Court 2021.

(2) However, in the event that any document is rejected through no fault of the filing party, a solicitor may —

>(a) re-file the document with a request that the date and time of filing or issuance, as the case may be, be back-dated to an earlier date and time, pursuant to Order 28, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court 2021; and

>(b) request a refund of the penalty by filing the requisite electronic form through the Electronic Filing Service.

(3) Where permission of Court has been obtained to expunge parts of a document or affidavit from the Court record, an applicant or his solicitor must re-file the document or affidavit with the expunged parts redacted. 

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a filing fee will be payable in respect of the re-filed document or affidavit as specified in the Fourth Schedule of the Rules of Court 2021 and the filing fee paid on the earlier filing of that document or affidavit will not be refunded.


## 91. Filing documents through service bureau

(1) Solicitors and law firms are encouraged to file documents through the Electronic Filing Service. However, in the event that certain documents cannot be filed through the Electronic Filing Service, solicitors and law firms may file documents through the service bureau. Litigants-in-person may also file documents through the service bureau.

(2) The operating hours of the service bureau may be found on the Electronic Filing Service website at <https://www.elitigation.sg>.

## 92. Filing of documents to the State Courts through a Supreme Court or Family Justice Courts service bureau

Pursuant to Order 28, Rules 17(4) and 17(6) of the Rules of Court 2021, the Registrar hereby prescribes that any service bureau established or authorised to be established by the Registrar of the Supreme Court or the Registrar of the Family Justice Courts may assist in the filing, service, delivery or conveyance of documents pertaining to proceedings in the State Courts using the Electronic Filing Service if the service bureau, or, if there are more than one, all the service bureaux, established or authorised to be established by the Registrar are unable to provide such services owing to failure of hardware or software, or both.


## 93. Hard copies of documents filed electronically

(1) The Registrar may, at his discretion, request for hard copies of any documents filed electronically.

(2) Upon such request, the filing party or his solicitor shall furnish hard copies of the relevant documents at the venue specified by the Registrar —

>(a) within the specified time frame; or

>(b) within 24 hours of the request, if no time frame is specified.

(3) The Registrar may also direct that any or all documents shall be filed in hardcopy instead of using the Electronic Filing Service for such period or periods as he in his discretion thinks fit. 


## 94. Responsibility for accuracy and completeness of information submitted using the Electronic Filing Service

(1) The solicitor having the conduct of any cause or matter may delegate the task of filing originating processes and documents in Court to an assistant or a suitably experienced law clerk or secretary, provided always that the solicitor shall personally satisfy himself as to the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted to the Court, and shall personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies.

(2) In particular, solicitors should ensure the following:

>(a) that the title of the action generated using the Electronic Filing Service is accurate and correct;

>(b) where an action is commenced by way of an Originating Claim, that at least one nature of claim is selected that adequately represents the subject matter of the action; and

>(c) where an action is commenced by way of an Originating Application, that either the relevant legislation under which the action is brought is provided or at least one nature of claim is selected that adequately represents the subject matter of the action.


## 95. Requests and other correspondence

(1) All Requests relating to or in connection with any pending cause or matter are to be made using the electronic forms available through the Electronic Filing Service. 

(2) Where an electronic form is available through the Electronic Filing Service for the Request that is sought, the Registrar has the discretion to refuse acceptance of other forms of written correspondence (including letters or facsimiles) and to refuse to act on such correspondence.

(3) Apart from Requests coming within the description of paragraph (1), all correspondence relating to or in connection with any cause or matter shall be addressed to the Registrar.

(4) In addition, all letters should be captioned with the number of the cause to which they relate and the names of the parties. For example:

>> **“DC/OC [NO. 12345/2021]** (if originating claim) **Between AB** (and **ANOR** or **ORS**, if there are 2 or more claimants, as the case may be) and **CD** (and **ANOR** or **ORS**, if there are 2 or more defendants, as the case may be)”

(5) If the correspondence relates to an interlocutory application or applications, the reference number of that application or those applications should be stated in the caption below the parties' names. For example:

>> **“SUMMONS NO. 98765 OF 2021”**

(6) Compliance with the provisions of this Practice Direction will facilitate the expeditious location of the relevant cause file.

### ***Cases which have been commenced using the Electronic Filing Service***

(7) For cases which have been commenced using the Electronic Filing Service, a letter is liable to be rejected if it is sent to the Court by a law firm in any way other than by filing the applicable Request through the Electronic Filing Service.

(8) Paragraph (7) does not apply to litigants-in-person.

(9) If a letter is sent to the Court by a law firm without the information specified in paragraph (4), it is also liable to be rejected.

(10) Registrar’s Directions and Notices from the Registry will be sent to law firms who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service through the Electronic Filing Service.
