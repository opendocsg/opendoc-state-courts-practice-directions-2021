<h2 id="58-witnesses">58. Witnesses</h2>

<h3 id="issuance-of-order-to-attend-court"><strong><em>Issuance of Order to Attend Court</em></strong></h3>

<p>(1) A request for the Registrar to issue an order to attend court or an order to produce documents pursuant to Order 15, Rule 4(1) of the Rules of Court 2021 is made by filing <a href="https://epd-statecourts-2021.opendoc.gov.sg/Forms/Appendix%20A2/Form%2029.pdf">Form 29</a> of Appendix A2 to these Practice Directions. An order to attend court or order to produce documents is issued when it is sealed by an officer of the Registry.</p>

<p>(1A) Where the issuance of an order to attend or order to produce documents is made under any written law for the purposes of a cause or matter that is not before the Court, the party must submit to the Registry 1 hardcopy each of his or her Request and the order to attend or order to produce documents to be sealed. An order to attend or order to produce documents is issued when the hard copy is sealed by an officer of the Registry.</p>

<p>(1) Any application for permission pursuant to section 62A of the Evidence Act 1893 for any person outside Singapore to give evidence by live video, live television or live audio link in any proceedings (other than proceedings in a criminal matter) must be made expeditiously and, in any case, unless the Court otherwise directs, no later than 4 weeks before the date of commencement of the hearing at which the person is to give evidence. The application is to be made by way of a summons with notice with a supporting affidavit.</p>

<p>(2) A party applying for permission for any person outside Singapore to give evidence by live video, live television or live audio link must take note of the relevant legislation and requirements in force in the foreign country or territory where the person is giving evidence. Certain countries or territories may impose prohibitions against, restrictions on, or requirements to obtain permission for or relating to, the giving of evidence by a person in that country or territory for court proceedings in a different country or territory. The party applying for permission must make all necessary enquiries, and take all necessary steps, to ensure that the foreign country or territory where the person is giving evidence raises no objection to the giving of evidence in that country or territory, for court proceedings in Singapore. This may be done by any means that the party considers appropriate, including:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) obtaining advice from a foreign lawyer qualified to advise on the laws of the relevant foreign country or territory;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) making enquiries with the relevant authorities; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) obtaining permission from the relevant foreign country or territory, in accordance with any applicable procedure, for evidence to be given by a person located in that country or territory through a live video or live television link, if such permission is required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) The necessary enquiries and steps referred to in paragraph (2) above must be made prior to the application referred to in paragraph (1) above and evidence of the enquiries and steps taken must be given in the supporting affidavit to the application.</p>

<p>(4) An application to the General Division of the High Court for the issue of a letter of request, to the relevant authorities of a foreign jurisdiction, for permission for evidence to be given by live video or live television link by a person located in that jurisdiction, must be made expeditiously and, unless the Court otherwise directs, not later than 8 weeks before the date of commencement of the hearing at which the person is to give evidence. In this regard, parties should write to the State Courts at the earliest possible juncture to inform the Court of their intention to take out such an application in the General Division of the High Court.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="pagination"><strong><em>Pagination</em></strong></h3>

<p>(3) Every page of the exhibits, <em>including cover pages, dividing sheets or separators between exhibits</em>, shall be consecutively numbered at the top right-hand corner of each page, following from the page numbers of the affidavit (<em>ie</em>, the first page of the exhibits shall take the number following the last sheet of the affidavit’s main text).

<h3 id="dividing-sheets"><strong><em>Dividing Sheets</em></strong></h3>

<p>(4) The exhibits in an affidavit shall be prefaced by a dividing sheet, marked, typed or stamped clearly with an exhibit mark as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“This is the exhibit marked [letter of the alphabet or a number] referred to in <br />
the affidavit of [name of the deponent] and sworn/affirmed before me this <br />
[date on which the affidavit is sworn or affirmed].</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A Commissioner for Oaths”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bookmark"><strong><em>Bookmark</em></strong></h3>

<p>(5) Each exhibit in the affidavit must be separately bookmarked in the PDF document that is filed. The names of the bookmarks should follow the initials of the deponent of the affidavit, <em>eg</em>, “TAK-1”, “TAK-2”.</p>

<p>(6) Where a deponent deposes to more than one affidavit with exhibits in the same action, the numbering of the exhibits in all subsequent affidavits shall run consecutively throughout, and not begin again with each affidavit. For instance, where a deponent in his first affidavit has marked two exhibits as “TAK-1” and “TAK-2”, the first exhibit in his second affidavit should be marked as “TAK-3” instead of “TAK-1”.</p>

<h3 id="references-to-exhibits-in-other-affidavits"><strong><em>References to exhibits in other affidavits</em></strong></h3>

<p>(7) Where a deponent wishes to refer to documents already exhibited to some other deponent’s affidavit, he must exhibit them to his own affidavit pursuant to Order 15, Rule 27(1) of the Rules of Court 2021.</p>

<h3 id="related-documents"><strong><em>Related documents</em></strong></h3>

<h2 id="63-swearing-or-affirming-of-affidavits-statutory-declarations-and-oaths">63. Swearing or affirming of affidavits, statutory declarations and oaths</h2>

<p>(1) Advocates and solicitors are requested to encourage their clients to use the services of other advocates and solicitors who are appointed commissioners for oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which the oaths are to be taken. The State Courts’ commissioners for oaths will continue to take affidavits or statutory declarations and administer oaths for legally aided cases and for parties who are acting in person who need to file documents in the State Courts.</p>

<p>(2) If arrangements for the use of the services of advocates and solicitors who are appointed as commissioners for oaths are not possible, deponents who are blind or illiterate in English may continue to be brought by solicitors to the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits and statutory declarations. As the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the deponent understands the document being deposed to, they are obliged to interpret the document to intended deponents; this is also the case in relation to blind deponents. This necessary exercise may take a considerable time and may cause long delays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths.</p>

<p>(3) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring illiterate or blind deponents before the State Courts’ commissioners for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken to interpret the document or documents to be deposed to. If it is estimated that the total time required for interpretation of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the solicitor must write to the Registrar and arrange for a special appointment for the documents to be sworn or affirmed; the solicitor should not bring the deponent before the duty commissioner for oaths without such an appointment.</p>

<p>(4) If an illiterate or a blind deponent is brought before the duty State Courts commissioner for oaths and the interpretation of the document or documents takes more than 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the deponent to the Registrar for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be deposed to.</p>

<p>(5) Save in exceptional circumstances, the State Courts will not entertain requests from advocates and solicitors for its commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits or statutory declarations or administer oaths to a deponent outside the State Courts’ premises. Advocates and solicitors appointed as commissioners for oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which oaths are to be taken, are instead encouraged to perform this function.</p>

<p>(6) For the purposes of Order 15, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court 2021, the deponent and the commissioner for oaths may sign the affidavit electronically by applying a security procedure that results in a secure electronic signature under section 18 of the Electronic Transactions Act 2010.</p>

<p>(7) The affidavit should be made, as far as possible, as if the deponent were appearing before the commissioner for oaths in person, and the attestation must state that the affidavit was sworn (or affirmed) and signed in Singapore with the deponent appearing before the commissioner for oaths through a live video link or live television link, or that the affidavit was signed by the deponent and/or the commissioner for oaths electronically in Singapore, or both, as the case may be.</p>

<p>(2) The notice in Form 18 should set out all the objections to the contents of affidavits of evidence-in-chief that will be raised at the hearing of the cause or matter and all the grounds thereof.</p>

<p>(3) An adjudication on the material objected to in affidavits of evidence-in-chief filed pursuant to an order of the Court should only be sought at the trial or hearing of the cause or matter for which the affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed, and not before. If an adjudication is sought prior to the trial or hearing of the cause or matter, the application for the adjudication will be adjourned to be dealt with at the trial or hearing of the cause or matter, and the applicant may be ordered to pay the costs of the adjournment.</p>
