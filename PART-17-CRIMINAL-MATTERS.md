>> 
>> (iii)	the reasons for making such an application, and in particular, why it would be in the interests of justice to allow the application;
>

>> (i)	whether the witness is a witness specified in section 281(5B)(_c_) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, and if so, the capacity of the witness (_eg_, an expert witness, factual witness or otherwise);
>> 
>> (ii)	the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements to be made at the place from which the witness is to give evidence; and
>> 
>> (iii)	the reasons for making such an application, and in particular, why it would be in the interests of justice to allow the application.

The oral proceedings, including the testimony of the witness, will be relayed and broadcast through the courtroom speaker system. When a video link session is in progress, prosecutors and counsel who are physically in Court are reminded to speak clearly and slowly into the microphones which are placed on the tables. In order to ensure clarity in the audio transmissions, no two persons should speak simultaneously into the microphones.
