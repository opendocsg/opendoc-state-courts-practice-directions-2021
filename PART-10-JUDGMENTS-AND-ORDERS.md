# PART X: JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS

## 76. Draft orders of Court

(1) In this Practice Direction, “order” has the same meaning as that given in Order 17 of the Rules of Court 2021. 

(2) Parties to summonses shall, after agreeing on the draft judgment, engross a final copy of such draft for the Registrar’s signature. Draft orders of Court for summonses without notice may be submitted with the summons and the supporting affidavit when these are filed. 

(3) Unless the Registrar or the Court orders otherwise, draft orders shall be composed in electronic form through the Electronic Litigation System.

(4) Subject to paragraph (6), parties in applications made with notice should proceed to engross a final copy of the draft judgment for signature by the Registrar after agreeing on the draft. 

(5) Draft orders of Court for applications without notice should be submitted to the Registrar.

(6) For draft orders in electronic form that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, the process for extracting judgments and orders shall be as follows:

>(a) Parties have the option of filing a system-generated order of Court through the Electronic Filing Service.

>(b) Before filing the system-generated order of Court, the party extracting the order must review and edit the order of Court electronic form to ensure that it accurately reflects the orders made by the Court and obtain the approval of all other parties to the application and provide evidence of such approval when filing the draft order of Court, for example, a Portable Document Format copy of a draft order of Court signed by the solicitors of all parties to the application.

>(c) A party writing to the Court to resolve a dispute on the terms of a draft pursuant to Order 17, Rule 3(7) of the Rules of Court 2021 must include in its letter to Court all versions of the disputed terms put forth by the parties as well as all relevant correspondence concerning the dispute.

>(d) The Registry will seal and issue an engrossed order of Court once its terms are approved.

(7) Order 17, Rule 3(5) and (6) of the Rules of Court 2021 place the burden of approving the drafts of judgments and orders on the solicitors themselves. The solicitors should therefore approve the drafts and not submit these drafts to the Registrar for approval.

(8) The Registrar’s signature on a judgment or order is only for the purpose of validity and does not in any way affect the regularity or irregularity of the contents of any judgment or order.

(9) Order 17, Rule 3(7) and (8) of the Rules of Court 2021 will continue to apply. Specifically:

>(a) In any case where there is a dispute on the terms of the draft, the party who drew up the order may write to the Court to resolve the dispute and the letter must set out the areas of dispute. 

>(b) The party who drew up the order is responsible for including in the letter all versions of the terms of the draft in dispute between the parties and all relevant correspondence. 

>(c) The Court may give its decision on the dispute on the terms of the draft without the attendance of the parties or fix a hearing to hear the parties on the dispute. 


## 77. Unnecessary extraction of orders of Court

To reduce unnecessary documentation and to expedite proceedings, solicitors are requested not to extract orders that need not be drawn up, as provided for in Order 17, Rule 3(1) of the Rules of Court 2021.


## 78. Judgments in default

(1) This Practice Direction applies to an application for judgment, to be given against a defendant in an Originating Claim, where the defendant:

>>(ii) a Defence or Defence to Counterclaim; or 

>(b) states in his notice of intention to contest or not to contest that he does not intend to contest all or some of the claims. 

(2) A claimant (or a party in an equivalent position) may apply for a default judgment by filing the following documents through the Electronic Filing Service:

>(d) an itemised Note of Costs, stating the costs and disbursements to which he is entitled (if any); 

>(e) the necessary supporting documents where there is a claim for contractual interest (see Practice Direction 80); and

(3) In order to satisfy itself that a defendant is in default of a notice of intention to contest or not contest a claim or service of defence or defence to counterclaim, the Court may require an affidavit to be filed stating the time and manner service of the Originating Claim (or counterclaim, where judgment is sought for failure to file and serve a defence to counterclaim) was effected on the defendant, as well as the steps taken to ascertain that the defendant had failed to serve a notice of intention to contest or not contest a claim or a defence or a defence to counterclaim, as the case may be.

 
## 79. Consent judgments
